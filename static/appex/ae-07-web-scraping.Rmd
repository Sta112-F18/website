1. Clone your assignment repo in RStudio Cloud (`ae-07-web-scraping-TEAMNAME`)
2. Open the R script called `scrape-tvshows.R`
3. Scrape the names, scores, and years of most popular TV shows on IMDB:
[www.imdb.com/chart/tvmeter](http://www.imdb.com/chart/tvmeter)
4. Create a data frame called `tvshows` with four variables 
(`rank`, `name`, `score`, `year`)  
5. Examine each of the **first three** TV shows to also obtain 
  - Genre
  - Runtime
  - How many episodes so far
  - First five plot keywords
6. Add this information to the `tvshows` data frame you created earlier
