A key part of [Pokémon Go](http://www.Pokémongo.com/) is using evolutions to 
get stronger Pokémon, and a deeper understanding of evolutions is key to being 
the greatest Pokémon Go player of all time. The data set you will be working 
with for this assignment covers 75 Pokémon evolutions spread across four 
species. A wide set of variables are provided, allowing a deeper dive into what 
characteristics are important in predicting a Pokémon's final combat power (CP).

# Getting started

Go to your email and accept the repo for this homework assignment. The name of 
the repo is `hw-04-pokemon-GITHUBNAME`, where `GITHUBNAME` is your GitHub
username. This repo contains a template R Markdown file that you can build on 
to complete your assignment.  

Clone your repo to RStudio Cloud, and then configure your name and email address 
for Git. To do so, follow these steps:

- Go to the *Terminal* pane
- Type the following two lines of code, replacing the information in the quotation marks with your info:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.email "your email"
git config --global user.name "your name"
```

Before you move further, also update your project name from *Untitled Project* to
*HW 04 - Pokemon*.

In the R Markdown file in your project, update your name, knit the document, 
commit, and push. 

At this point you might be getting tired of having to type your username and 
password everytime you push to GitHub. If you would like your git password 
cached for a week for this project, type the following in the Terminal:

```{marginfigure}
60 seconds per minute * 60 minutes per hour * 24 hours per day * 7 days per week = 604800 seconds
```

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 604800'
```

# Analysis

## Data

The dataset for this assignment can be found as a csv file at [here](https://www.openintro.org/stat/data/?data=Pokémon). The variable 
descriptions are as follows:

- `name`: A unique name given to the Pokémon
- `species`: The Pokémon's type, e.g. Pidgey.
- `cp`: Pre-evolution Combat Power, which is a summary of the Pokémon's strength 
for battling prior to the evolution of the Pokémon.
- `hp`: Pre-evolution Hit Points, which is a summary of how difficult it is to 
weaken the Pokémon in a battle.
- `weight`: Pre-evolution weight, in kilograms.
- `height`: Pre-evolution height, in meters.
- `power_up_stardust`: Pre-evolution stardust required to power up the Pokémon.
- `power_up_candy`: Pre-evolution candy required to power up the Pokémon.
- `attack_weak`: The name of the pre-evolution weaker attack of the Pokémon.
- `attack_weak_type`: The type of the pre-evolution weaker attack.
- `attack_weak_value`: The damage done by the pre-evolution weaker attack.
- `attack_strong`: The name of the pre-evolution stronger attack.
- `attack_strong_type`: The type of the pre-evolution stronger attack.
- `attack_strong_value`: The damage done by the pre-evolution stronger attack.
- `cp_new`: Post-evolution Combat Power.
- `hp_new`: Post-evolution Hit Points.
- `weight_new`: Post-evolution weight, in kilograms.
- `height_new`: Post-evolution height, in meters.
- `power_up_stardust_new`: Post-evolution stardust required to power up the 
Pokémon.
- `power_up_candy_new`: Post-evolution candy required to power up the Pokémon.
- `attack_weak_new`: The name of the post-evolution weaker attack.
- `attack_weak_type_new`: The type of the post-evolution weaker attack.
- `attack_weak_value_new`: The damage done by the post-evolution weaker attack.
- `attack_strong_new`: The name of the post-evolution stronger attack.
- `attack_strong_type_new`: The type of the post-evolution stronger attack.
- `attack_strong_value_new`: The damage done by the post-evolution stronger 
attack.
- `notes`: Any additional notes made while collecting the data.

## Packages

In this lab we will work with the `tidyverse` and `scales` packages. This package 
has already been installed for you, and is loaded in your R Markdown file as well.

If you'd like to run your code in the Console as well you'll also need to 
load the packages there. To do so, run the following in the console. 

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(scales) 
```

## Exercises

1. Calculate the diference in heights pre and post evolution and save this as a 
new variable, `height_diff`. Calculate the percentage of Pokémon that grew 
during evolution. Also visualize the distribution of change in height by 
species and provide a discussion of how change in height varies across species.

*This is a good place to pause, commit changes with an informative commit message, and push. Make sure to commit and push all changed files.*

2. Pick two categorical variables and make a bar plot that depicts the 
relationship between them. These can be variables from the original data or 
ones that you create based on the given data.

*This is another good place to pause, commit changes with an informative commit message, and push. Make sure to commit and push all changed files.*

3. Pick a numerical and a categorical variable, and construct side-by-side box 
plots depicting the relationship between them.

*Don't forget to commit and push your changes sporadically while working on your homework assignment.*

4. Learn something new: violin plots! Read about them at http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_violin.html, 
and convert your side-by-side box plots from the previous task to violin plots. 
What do the violin plots reveal that box plots do not? What features are 
apparent in the box plots but not in the violin plots?

5. Recreate the following plot, and interpret what you see in context of the data.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pokemon <- read_csv("data/pokemon.csv")
pokemon %>% 
  filter(species != "Weedle") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = species, fill = attack_weak)) + 
    geom_bar(position="dodge") + 
    coord_flip() +
    labs(x = "Species", y = "Frequency", fill = "Attack weak",
         title = "Pre-evolution weaker attack of Pokémon",
         subtitle = "by species") +
    theme_minimal()
```

6. Recreate the following plot. Note that `height_diff` refers to difference in 
height between pre and post-evolution, and `weight_diff` is calculated similarly.

```{marginfigure}
Hint: The colors are from the viridis color palette. Take a look at the functions 
starting with `scale_viridis_*`.
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
pokemon %>%
  mutate(
    weight_diff = weight_new - weight,
    height_diff = height_new - height
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = height_diff, y = weight_diff, color = species)) +
    geom_point(position = "jitter") +
    scale_color_viridis_d() +
    theme_minimal()
```

7. Rework the previous plot using principles of effective data visualizations 
we have learned about in class. Then, deescribe the relationship between the 
changes in heights and weights of Pokemon and their species.

8. Describe what the following code is doing in each line, and interpret 
the numbers in the output.

```{marginfigure}
Hint: We use the `::` operator to explicitly indicate that the FUN in 
`PKG::FUN` is in the PKG.
```

```{r}
pokemon %>%
  group_by(species, attack_weak_type_new) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(prop = scales::percent(n / sum(n)))
```


9. What characteristics correspond to an evolved Pokémon with a high combat 
power? You do not need to come up with an exhaustive list, but you should walk 
us through your reasoning for answering this question and include all relevant 
summary statistics and visualizations.

# Getting help

Use the #questions channel on Slack.

- R errors/questions: Make a minimum reproducible example instead of sharing 
large portions of your code.
- Git/GitHub errors/questions: Clearly outline your steps that got you to the 
point you're in.

You are also welcomed to discuss the homework with each other broadly 
(no sharing code!) as well as ask questions at office hours.
