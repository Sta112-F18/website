# Inference

.question[
What does inference mean?
]

--

- Statistical inference is the process of using sample data to make conclusions 
about the underlying population the sample came from
- Types of inference: testing and estimation
- Today we discuss estimation, next time testing

# Confidence intervals

---

## Confidence intervals

A plausible range of values for the population parameter is a **confidence interval**.

.pull-left[
![spear](img/spear.png)
]
.pull-right[
![net](img/net.png)
]

- If we report a point estimate, we probably won’t hit the exact population 
parameter.
- If we report a range of plausible values we have a good shot at capturing 
the parameter.

---

## Variability of sample statistics

- In order to construct a confidence interval we need to quantify the variability 
of our sample statistic.
- For example, if we want to construct a confidence interval for a population mean, 
we need to come up with a plausible range of values around our observsed sample mean.
- This range will depend on how precise and how accurate our sample mean is as an 
estimate of the population mean.
- Quantifying this requires a measurement of how much we would expect the sample 
mean to vary from sample to sample.

.question[
Suppose you randomly sample 50 students and 5 of them are left handed. If you 
were to take another random sample of 50 students, how many would you expect to 
be left handed? Would you be surprised if only 3 of them were left handed? Would 
you be surprised if 40 of them were left handed?

## Quantifying the variability of a sample statistic

We can quantify the variability of sample statistics using

- simulation: via bootstrapping (today)

or

- theory: via Central Limit Theorem (later in the course)

# Bootstrapping

---

## Bootstrapping

&lt;img src="img/boot.png" style="float:right"&gt;

- The term **bootstrapping** comes from the phrase "pulling oneself up by one’s 
bootstraps", which is a metaphor for accomplishing an impossible task without 
any outside help.
- In this case the impossible task is estimating a population parameter, and we’ll 
accomplish it using data from only the given sample.
- Note that this notion of saying something about a population parameter using 
only information from an observed sample is the crux of statistical inference, 
it is not limited to bootstrapping.

## Rent in Manhattan

.question[
How much do you think a typical 1 BR apartment in Manhattan rents for?
]

---

## Sample

On a given day, twenty 1 BR apartments were randomly selected on Craigslist 
Manhattan from apartments listed as "by owner".


```r
library(tidyverse)
manhattan &lt;- read_csv("data/manhattan.csv")
```


```r
manhattan %&gt;% slice(1:10)
```

```

## Bootstrapping scheme

1. Take a bootstrap sample - a random sample taken with replacement from the 
original sample, of the same size as the original sample.
2. Calculate the bootstrap statistic - a statistic such as mean, median, 
proportion, slope, etc. computed on the bootstrap samples.
3. Repeat steps (1) and (2) many times to create a bootstrap distribution - 
a distribution of bootstrap statistics.
4. Calculate the bounds of the XX% confidence interval as the middle XX% 
of the bootstrap distribution.

A 95% confidence interval is bounded by the middle 95% of the bootstrap distribution.


```r

  summarize(lower = quantile(stat, 0.025),
            upper = quantile(stat, 0.975))
```

## Interpret the confidence interval

.question[
The 95% confidence interval for the median rent of one bedroom apartments in 
Manhattan was calculated as (2162.5, 2875). Which of the 
following is the correct interpretation of this interval?
]

(a) 95% of the time the median rent one bedroom apartments in this sample is between $2162.5 and $2875.

(b) 95% of all one bedroom apartments in Manhattan have rents between $2162.5 and $2875.

(c) We are 95% confident that the median rent of all one bedroom apartments is between $2162.5 and $2875.

(d) We are 95% confident that the median rent one bedroom apartments in this sample is between $2162.5 and $2875.

# Accuracy vs. precision

## Confidence level

**We are 95% confident that ...**

- Suppose we took many samples from the original population and built a 95% confidence interval based on each sample.
- Then about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.

---

## Commonly used confidence levels

Commonly used confidence levels in practice are 90%, 95%, and 99%

.question[
Which line (orange dash/dot, blue dash, green dot) represents which confidence level?

## Precision vs. accuracy

.question[
If we want to be very certain that we capture the population parameter, should 
we use a wider interval or a narrower interval? What drawbacks are associated 
with using a wider interval?

## Calculating confidence intervals at various confidence levels

.question[
How would you modify the following code to calculate a 90% confidence interval? 
How would you modify it for a 99% confidence interval?
]


```r
manhattan %&gt;%
  specify(response = rent) %&gt;% 
  generate(reps = 15000, type = "bootstrap") %&gt;% 
  calculate(stat = "median") %&gt;%
  summarize(lower = quantile(stat, 0.025),
            upper = quantile(stat, 0.975))
```

## Recap

- Sample statistic `\(\ne\)` population parameter, but if the sample is good, it can be a good estimate.
- We report that estimate with a confidence bound around it, and the width of this bound depends on how variable sample statistics from different samples from the population would be.
- Since we can't continue sampling from the population, we instead bootstrap from the one sample we have to estimate the sampling variability.
- We can do this for any sample statistic:
  - We did it for a median today, `calculate(stat = "median")`
  - Doing it for a mean would just take `calculate(stat = "mean")`
  - And you'll learn about calculating bootstrap intervals for other statistics
