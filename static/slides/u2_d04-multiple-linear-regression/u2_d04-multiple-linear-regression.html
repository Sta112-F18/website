## Getting started

**Data:** Paris Paintings


```r
pp &lt;- read_csv("data/paris_paintings.csv", 
               na = c("n/a", "", "NA"))
```

---

## Multiple predictors

- Response variable: log(price)
- Explanatory variables: Width and height


```r
m_wi_hgt &lt;- lm(log(price) ~ Width_in + Height_in, data = pp)
tidy(m_wi_hgt)
```

```

## Exploration 1

### Price, surface area, and living artist

- Explore the relationship between price of paintings and surface area, conditioned 
on whether or not the artist is still living
- First visualize and explore, then model

---

## Typical surface area

.question[
What is the typical surface area for paintings?
]

![](u2_d04-multiple-linear-regression_files/figure-html/viz-surf-artistliving-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

--

Less than 1000 square inches (which is roughly a painting that is 31in x 31in). There are very few paintings that have surface area above 5000 square inches.

---

## Narrowing the scope

For simplicity let's focus on the paintings with `Surface &lt; 5000`:


```r
pp_Surf_lt_5000 &lt;- pp %&gt;%
  filter(Surface &lt; 5000)
```

![](u2_d04-multiple-linear-regression_files/figure-html/viz-surf-lt-5000-artistliving-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

## Two ways to model

- **Main effects:** Assuming relationship between surface and logged price 
**does not vary** by whether or not the artist is living.
- **Interaction effects:** Assuming relationship between surface and logged 
price **varies** by whether or not the artist is living.

## Fit model with main effects

- Response variable: log(price)
- Explanatory variables: Surface area and artist living (0/1 variable)

.midi[

```r
m_main &lt;- lm(log(price) ~ Surface + factor(artistliving), 
             data = pp_Surf_lt_5000)
tidy(m_main)

## 3 factor(artistliving)1 0.137    0.0970         1.41 1.57e- 1
```
]


--
- Linear model:
$$ \widehat{log(price)} = 4.88 + 0.000265~surface + 0.137~artistliving $$

---

## Solving the model

![](u2_d04-multiple-linear-regression_files/figure-html/viz-main-effects-2-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

--
- Non-living artist: Plug in 0 for `artistliving`
`\(\widehat{log(price)} = 4.88 + 0.000265~surface + 0.137 \times 0\)`  
`\(= 4.88 + 0.000265~surface\)`

--
- Living artist: Plug in 1 for `artistliving`
`\(\widehat{log(price)} = 4.88 + 0.000265~surface + 0.137 \times 1\)`  
`\(= 5.017 + 0.000265~surface\)`

---

## Visualizing main effects

![](u2_d04-multiple-linear-regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

- **Same slope:** Rate of change in price as the surface area increases does 
not vary between paintings by living and non-living artists.
- **Different intercept:** Paintings by living artists are consistently more 
expensive than paintings by non-living artists.

---

## Interpreting main effects

.midi[

```r
tidy(m_main) %&gt;% 
  mutate(exp_estimate = exp(estimate)) %&gt;%
  select(term, estimate, exp_estimate)
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##   term                  estimate exp_estimate
##   &lt;chr&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 (Intercept)           4.88           132.  
## 2 Surface               0.000265         1.00
## 3 factor(artistliving)1 0.137            1.15
```
]

- All else held constant, for each additional square inch in painting's surface area, the price of the painting is predicted, on average, to be higher by a factor of 1.
- All else held constant, paintings by a living artist are predicted, on average, to be higher by a factor of 1.15 compared to paintings by an artist who is no longer alive.
- Paintings that are by an artist who is not alive and that have a surface area of 0 square inches are predicted, on average, to be 132 livres.

## What went wrong?

.question[
Why is our linear regression model different from what we got from `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`?
]

.pull-left[
![](u2_d04-multiple-linear-regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
.pull-right[
![](u2_d04-multiple-linear-regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---

## What went wrong? (cont.)

- The way we specified our model only lets `artistliving` affect the intercept.
- Model implicitly assumes that paintings with living and deceased artists have the *same slope* and only allows for *different intercepts*.  
- What seems more appropriate in this case? 
    + Same slope and same intercept for both colors
    + Same slope and different intercept for both colors
    + Different slope and different intercept for both colors?

---

## Interacting explanatory variables

- Including an interaction effect in the model allows for different slopes, i.e. 
nonparallel lines.
- This implies that the regression coefficient for an explanatory variable would 
change as another explanatory variable changes.
- This can be accomplished by adding an interaction variable: the product of two 
explanatory variables.

---

## Interaction: surface * artist living

.small[

```r
ggplot(data = pp_Surf_lt_5000,
       mapping = aes(y = log(price), x = Surface, 
                     color = factor(artistliving))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Surface", y = "Log(price)", color = "Living artist")
```

## Fit model with interaction effects

- Explanatory variables: Surface area, artist living (0/1 variable), and 
their interaction

## 4 Surface:factor(artistliving)1  0.000479 0.000126       3.81 0.000139
```
]

- Linear model:
$$ \widehat{log(price)} = 4.91 + 0.00021~surface - 0.126~artistliving $$
$$+ ~ 0.00048~surface \times artistliving $$

---

## Interpretation of interaction effects

- Rate of change in price as the surface area of the painting increases does 
vary between paintings by living and non-living artists (different slopes), 
- Some paintings by living artists are more expensive than paintings by
non-living artists, and some are not (different intercept).

## Third order interactions

- Can you? Yes
- Should you? Probably not if you want to interpret these interactions in context
of the data.

# Quality of fit in MLR

## R-squared

- `\(R^2\)` is the percentage of variability in the response variable explained by the 
regression model.


```r
glance(m_main)$r.squared
```

```
## [1] 0.01320884
```

```r
glance(m_int)$r.squared
```

```
## [1] 0.0176922
```

--
- Clearly the model with interactions has a higher `\(R^2\)`.

--
- However using `\(R^2\)` for model selection in models with multiple explanatory 
variables is not a good idea as `\(R^2\)` increases when **any** variable is added 
to the model.

---

## R-squared - first principles

$$ R^2 =  \frac{ SS\_{Reg} }{ SS\_{Total} } = 1 - \left( \frac{ SS\_{Error} }{ SS\_{Total} } \right) $$

.question[
Calculate `\(R^2\)` based on the output below.

```

---

## Adjusted R-squared

$$ R^2\_{adj} = 1 - \left( \frac{ SS\_{Error} }{ SS\_{Total} } \times \frac{n - 1}{n - k - 1} \right), $$

where `\(n\)` is the number of cases and `\(k\)` is the number of predictors in the model

--
- Adjusted `\(R^2\)` doesn't increase if the new variable does not provide any new 
informaton or is completely unrelated.

--
- This makes adjusted `\(R^2\)` a preferable metric for model selection in multiple
regression models.

---

## In pursuit of Occam's Razor

- Occam's Razor states that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, 
the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.
- Model selection follows this principle.
- We only want to add another variable to the model if the addition of that
variable brings something valuable in terms of predictive power to the model.
- In other words, we prefer the simplest best model, i.e. **parsimonious** model.

---

## Comparing models

It appears that adding the interaction actually increased adjusted `\(R^2\)`, so we 
should indeed use the model with the interactions.

# Model selection

---

## Backwards elimination

- Start with **full** model (including all candidate explanatory variables and 
all candidate interactions)
- Remove one variable at a time, and select the model with the highest adjusted 
`\(R^2\)`
- Continue until adjusted `\(R^2\)` does not increase

---

## Forward selection

- Start with **empty** model
- Add one variable (or interaction effect) at a time, and select the model 
with the highest adjusted `\(R^2\)`
- Continue until adjusted `\(R^2\)` does not increase

---

## Model selection and interaction effects

Model selection for models including interaction effects must follow the 
following two principles:

- If an interaction is included in the model, the main effects of both of 
those variables must also be in the model.
- If a main effect is not in the model, then its interaction should not be 
in the model.

---

## Other model selection criteria

- Adjusted `\(R^2\)` is one model selection criterion
- There are others out there (many many others!), we'll discuss some later in 
the course, and some you might see in other courses
