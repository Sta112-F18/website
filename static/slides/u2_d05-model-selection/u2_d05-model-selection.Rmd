# Quality of fit in MLR

---

## From last time...

Load data:

```{r recap1, message=FALSE}
pp <- read_csv("data/paris_paintings.csv", na = c("n/a", "", "NA"))
```

--
Filter for paintings < 5000 square inches:

```{r recap2}
pp_Surf_lt_5000 <- pp %>% filter(Surface < 5000)
```

--
Model with main effects only: 

```{r recap3}
m_main <- lm(log(price) ~ Surface + factor(artistliving), 
             data = pp_Surf_lt_5000)
```

--
Model with interaction effects:

```{r recap4}
m_int <- lm(log(price) ~ Surface + factor(artistliving) + 
              Surface * factor(artistliving), 
            data = pp_Surf_lt_5000)
```

---

## R-squared

- $R^2$ is the percentage of variability in the response variable explained by the 
regression model.

```{r}
glance(m_main)$r.squared
glance(m_int)$r.squared
```

--
- Clearly the model with interactions has a higher $R^2$.

--
- However using $R^2$ for model selection in models with multiple explanatory 
variables is not a good idea as $R^2$ increases when **any** variable is added 
to the model.

---

## R-squared - first principles

$$ R^2 =  \frac{ SS\_{Reg} }{ SS\_{Total} } = 1 - \left( \frac{ SS\_{Error} }{ SS\_{Total} } \right) $$

.question[
Calculate $R^2$ based on the output below.
]

```{r digits = 3}
anova(m_main)
```

---

## Adjusted R-squared

$$ R^2\_{adj} = 1 - \left( \frac{ SS\_{Error} }{ SS\_{Total} } \times \frac{n - 1}{n - k - 1} \right), $$

where $n$ is the number of cases and $k$ is the number of predictors in the model

--
- Adjusted $R^2$ doesn't increase if the new variable does not provide any new 
informaton or is completely unrelated.

--
- This makes adjusted $R^2$ a preferable metric for model selection in multiple
regression models.

---

## In pursuit of Occam's Razor

- Occam's Razor states that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, 
the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.
- Model selection follows this principle.
- We only want to add another variable to the model if the addition of that
variable brings something valuable in terms of predictive power to the model.
- In other words, we prefer the simplest best model, i.e. **parsimonious** model.

---

## Comparing models

It appears that adding the interaction actually increased adjusted $R^2$, so we 
should indeed use the model with the interactions.

```{r}
glance(m_main)$adj.r.squared
glance(m_int)$adj.r.squared
```

# Model selection

---

## Backwards elimination

- Start with **full** model (including all candidate explanatory variables and 
all candidate interactions)
- Remove one variable at a time, and select the model with the highest adjusted 
$R^2$
- Continue until adjusted $R^2$ does not increase

---

## Forward selection

- Start with **empty** model
- Add one variable (or interaction effect) at a time, and select the model 
with the highest adjusted $R^2$
- Continue until adjusted $R^2$ does not increase

---

## Model selection and interaction effects

Model selection for models including interaction effects must follow the 
following two principles:

- If an interaction is included in the model, the main effects of both of 
those variables must also be in the model.
- If a main effect is not in the model, then its interaction should not be 
in the model.

---

## Other model selection criteria

- Adjusted $R^2$ is one model selection criterion
- There are others out there (many many others!), we'll discuss some later in 
the course, and some you might see in other courses

## Exploration 2

### Price, surface area, material, shape

.small[
```{r}
m_sms <- lm(log(price) ~ Surface + mat + Shape, data = pp)
tidy(m_sms) %>%
  print(n = 25)
```
]

---

## Shape and material

Collapse levels of `Shape` and `mat`erial variables with `forcats::fct_collapse`:

.small[
```{r}
pp <- pp %>%
  mutate(
    Shape = fct_collapse(Shape, oval = c("oval", "ovale"),
                                round = c("round", "ronde"),
                                squ_rect = "squ_rect",
                                other = c("octogon", "octagon", "miniature")),
    mat = fct_collapse(mat, metal = c("a", "br", "c"),
                            canvas = c("co", "t", "ta"),
                            paper = c("p", "ca"),
                            wood = "b",
                            other = c("e", "g", "h", "mi", "o", "pa", "v", "al", "ar", "m"))
  )
```
]

---

## Review fixes

.pull-left[
```{r}
pp %>%
  count(Shape)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
pp %>%
  count(mat)
```
]

---

## Refit model

.question[
Interpret the slope for `matother`. *Hint:* What is the baseline level for the 
material variable?
]

```{r}
m_sms <- lm(log(price) ~ Surface + mat + Shape, data = pp)
tidy(m_sms)
```

---

## Change the baseline level

Change order of levels of the `mat` variable with `forcats::fct_relevel`:

```{r}
pp <- pp %>%
  mutate(mat = fct_relevel(mat, "other"))
levels(pp$mat)
```

---

## Refit model

.question[
Interpret the slope for `matmetal`. *Hint:* What is the baseline level for the 
material variable?
]

```{r}
m_sms <- lm(log(price) ~ Surface + mat + Shape, data = pp)
tidy(m_sms)
```

---

## Application exercise: 

### `ae-10-model-selection-pp`

- First, plan the full model
- Then, fit, evaluate, select
- Lastly, interpret the final model
