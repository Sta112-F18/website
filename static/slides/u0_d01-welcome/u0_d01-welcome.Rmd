Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. We're going to learn to do this in a `tidy` way -- more on that later!

- Incorporate your actual name.
- Reuse username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack.
- Pick a username you'll be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
- Shorter is better than longer.
- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible.

## Create your first data visualization

- Once you log on to RStudio Cloud, click on this course's workspace "STA 112FS - Fall 2018".
- Make a copy of the project called UN Votes, and launch it.
- In the Files pane in the bottom right corner, spot the file called `unvotes.Rmd`. Open it, and then click on the "Knit" button.
- Go back to the file and change your name on top (in the `yaml` -- we'll talk about what this means later) and knit again.
- Then change the country names to those you're interested in. Your spelling and capitalization should match how the countries appear in the data, so take a peek at the Appendix to see how the country names are spelled. Knit again. And voila, your first data visualization!
